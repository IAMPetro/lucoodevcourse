Basics of Object-Oriented Programming
=====================================

The topics discussed in this chapter are considered the basics of
object-oriented programming. Some of them are language-independent,
others are specific to C#, Java, or Scala. These topics, except
perhaps for the last two, are supposed to be covered by the
CS 1/2 prerequisite chain for this course.

Please stay tuned!
